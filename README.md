# Traffic--light-detection-using-yoloV4-and-Faster-RCNN
Project aims to detect and categorize traffic lights into 3 classes using 2 object detection algorithms: Faster R-CNN and YOLOv4. Both algorithms were tested on test images and found to achieve high accuracy, but Faster R-CNN is more accurate.
